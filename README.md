# AngularMovieTvDatabase

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Developer Notes

The app doesn't work as intended. For some reason the Observables are not being displayed from the http request. It might be the mapping of the HttpRequest to the Movie and Show arrays causing the issue. I tried tons of different tests and methods to get it
to at least function slightly to no avail.
